# Elasticsearch

This container is built from [Elasticsearch official 7.10 image](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docker.html) with a few modifications:

* All xpack plugins are disabled by default
* `jvm.options` file is modified to remove the jvm heap size settings, thus allowing to set them with `ES_JAVA_OPTS` environment variable (default to 512m).
* The GeoIP downloader is disabled by default
