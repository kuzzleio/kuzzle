# Elasticsearch 8

<SinceBadge version="2.32.0"/>

Kuzzle uses Elasticsearch as a [NoSQL document store](/core/2/guides/main-concepts/data-storage).

With Kuzzle, customers **can directly access data stored in the database** as long as they have the rights to do so.

Kuzzle exposes the [Elasticsearch Query Language](/core/2/guides/main-concepts/querying) in a secure way. It is therefore possible to **take full advantage of the possibilities of Elasticsearch** with boolean queries, aggregations, special fields, etc.

The support of Elasticsearch 8 has been introduced in Kuzzle 2.30.0.

The choice has been made to keep Kuzzle compatible to avoid breaking changes around the support of ES8. 

We wanted to allow the user to **opt-in** for this feature, so no modification is needed on your behalf if you want to keep using Elasticsearch 7.

The default major version of Elasticsearch will be 7 until Kuzzle v3.

The new configuration key to change the version supported is available under:  

```json
{
  "services": {
    "storageEngine": {
      "majorVersion": 8
    }
  }
}
```

:::warning
You can not set the `majorVersion` key to 8 if you are using a version of Kuzzle that does not support it. 
:::

:::info
Kuzzle cannot connect to both Elasticsearch 7 and Elasticsearch 8 at the same time.  
:::

Once the version is set to 8, Kuzzle will use the Elasticsearch 8 API to communicate with the database.

You will find below an example of a `docker-compose.yml` file to run Kuzzle with Elasticsearch 8.

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  node:
    image: kuzzleio/kuzzle:2
    depends_on:
      redis:
        condition: service_healthy
      elasticsearch:
        condition: service_healthy
    ports:
      - "7512:7512"
      - "7511:7511"
      - "7510:7510"
      - "9229:9229"
      - "1883:1883"
    environment:
      - kuzzle_services__storageEngine__client__node=http://elasticsearch:9200
      - kuzzle_services__storageEngine__commonMapping__dynamic=true
      - kuzzle_services__internalCache__node__host=redis
      - kuzzle_services__memoryStorage__node__host=redis
      - NODE_ENV=${NODE_ENV:-development}
      - DEBUG=${DEBUG:-none}
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:7512/_healthcheck"]
      timeout: 10s
      interval: 10s
      retries: 30
      start_period: 1m

  redis:
    image: redis:6
    ports:
      - '6379:6379'
    healthcheck:
      test: ['CMD', 'redis-cli', 'ping']
      interval: 1s
      timeout: 3s
      retries: 30

  elasticsearch:
    image: elasticsearch:8.11.3
    container_name: kuzzle_elasticsearch
    environment:
      - xpack.security.enabled=false
      - action.destructive_requires_name=false
      - cluster.name=kuzzle
      - node.name=alyx
      - discovery.type=single-node
      - ingest.geoip.downloader.enabled=false
      - indices.id_field_data.enabled=true
    ports:
      - '9200:9200'
    healthcheck:
      test: ['CMD', 'curl', '-f', 'http://localhost:9200']
      interval: 2s
      timeout: 2s
      retries: 10
    ulimits:
      nofile: 65536
```

Or you can run `kourou app:scaffold sandbox` to create a new Kuzzle project with a `docker-compose.yml` file that uses Elasticsearch 8.

## Migrating production data from Elasticsearch 7 to 8

Is this section, we will see how to migration en production environnement data from Elasticsearch 7.x to Elasticsearch 8.x

### Prerequisites

Before starting the migration process, ensure the following:
* __Backup your data__: Always backup your indices and cluster settings before starting the migration. Use the Snapshot and Restore feature for this.
* __Version Check__: Make sure your Elasticsearch 7.x is at the latest minor version. Elasticsearch supports migrating from the last minor version of the previous major version.

### Check Deprecation API

* Elasticsearch Deprecation API can be used to check for any features or settings in your current cluster that are deprecated or removed in the 8.x version. Address these issues before proceeding.
* Test in a **Non-Production Environment**
Conduct a dry run in a development environment to spot potential issues and estimate the duration the migration process might take.

### Migration Methods

Theire are 2 strategies to upgrade Elasticsearch in a production environment:
1. Re-indexing
	* Step 1: Create a new cluster running Elasticsearch 8.x.
	* Step 2: Take a snapshot of your data in the current 7.x cluster.
	* Step 3: Restore the snapshot into the new 8.x cluster.
1. Rolling Upgrade
	* Step 1: Disable Shard Allocation.
	* Step 2: Stop and upgrade a single Elasticsearch node.
	* Step 3: Enable Shard Allocation and allow the node to join the cluster and the cluster to re-balance.
	* Step 4: Repeat for each node in the cluster.

After you have migrated your data:
1. Post Upgrade Checks
	* Run the health and stats APIs to ensure the health of your newly upgraded cluster.
	* Update your clients and integrations to the latest version that's compatible with Elasticsearch 8.x, if not done already.
	* Monitor your cluster using the Monitoring API or third-party monitoring services.
1. Troubleshoot
	* If you encounter any issues during the migration process, take advantage of the Elasticsearch documentation, forums, and issue trackers for troubleshooting information and support.

> Note: Migration steps can vary depending on your setup and needs. Always refer to the official Elasticsearch documentation for the most accurate information, you can find it [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup-upgrade.html).

Disclaimer: The above steps provide a general migration guide. Migrations can be complex and it's advised to always test these steps in a **non-production environment** before applying them to production.
