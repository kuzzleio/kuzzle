# Data Storage

Kuzzle uses Elasticsearch as a **NoSQL document storage**.

The data storage is organized in 4 levels: 
  - Indexes
  - Collections
  - Documents
  - Fields

An **index** brings together several **collections**, which in turn contain several **documents**, each of which is composed of several **fields**.

If you're more familiar with the way relational databases store data, here is an analogy. Bear in mind that this is only to give you a rough point of comparison with a relational database, the similarities end here:

| Relational databases storage | Document-oriented storage |
| :--------------------------: | :-----------------------: |
| database                     | index                     |
| table                        | collection                |
| schema                       | mappings                  |
| line                         | document                  |
| column                       | field                     |

Elasticsearch is **primarily designed to be a search engine**, so there are **limitations when using it as a database**:
 - once set, mappings types cannot be changed
 - no transaction system
 - [Near Realtime Search](/core/2/guides/main-concepts/querying#mappings-dynamic-policy)

## Internal Representation

Elasticsearch does not have this notion of our two levels document-oriented storage.  

::: info
As the word index refers to Kuzzle indexes but also Elasticsearch indexes, we will rather **use the term indices for Elasticsearch indexes** to avoid confusion (also present in Elasticsearch documentation).
:::

Kuzzle indexes and collections are emulated in Elasticsearch in the following way:
 - **indexes does not physically exist in Elasticsearch** but are only logical application containers. When an index is created, an empty indice is created in Elasticsearch to reserve the index name (e.g. `&nyc-open-data._kuzzle_keep`)
 - **collections correspond to Elasticsearch indexes** with all their properties (e.g. [mappings](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.4/mapping.html), [settings](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.4/index-modules.html#index-modules-settings), etc)

Kuzzle distinguishes two types of storage: 
  - **private**: internal Kuzzle index, plugin private indexes. Those indexes can never be accessed directly from the Kuzzle API
  - **public**: indexes available through the Kuzzle API

Elasticsearch indices must comply to the following naming convention:
 - **private**: `%<kuzzle-index-name>.<kuzzle-collection-name>`
 - **public**: `&<kuzzle-index-name>.<kuzzle-collection-name>`

You can list Elasticsearch indices with this command:
```bash
kourou es:indices:cat

[
  # Kuzzle private indices
  "%kuzzle.api-keys",
  "%kuzzle.config",
  "%kuzzle.profiles",
  "%kuzzle.roles",
  "%kuzzle.users",
  "%kuzzle.validations",

  # Plugin auth local private indices
  "%plugin-kuzzle-plugin-auth-passport-local.config",
  "%plugin-kuzzle-plugin-auth-passport-local.users",

  # Public indices available through the API
  "&ktm-open-data._kuzzle_keep",
  "&ktm-open-data.thamel-taxi"
]

```

::: info
You can use the [admin:resetDatabase](/core/2/api/controllers/admin/reset-database) action to delete every public indexes.
:::

## Collection Mappings

With Elasticsearch, it is possible to **define mappings for collections**. These mappings refer to [Elasticsearch mappings](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.4/mapping.html) and allow you to configure the way Elasticsearch will store and reference document fields in these collections.

There are 3 root fields for mappings configuration:
 - [properties](/core/2/guides/main-concepts/data-storage#mappings-properties): collection types definition
 - [dynamic](/core/2/guides/main-concepts/data-storage#mappings-dynamic-policy): dynamic mapping policy against new fields
 - [_meta](/core/2/guides/main-concepts/data-storage#mappings-metadata): collection metadata

The following API actions can be used to modify these mappings:
 - [collection:create](/core/2/api/controllers/collection/create)
 - [collection:update](/core/2/api/controllers/collection/update)
 - [admin:loadMappings](/core/2/api/controllers/admin/load-mappings)

### Mappings Properties
The field type definitions that will be inserted in a collection allow Elasticsearch to index your data for future searches.

Especially when searching on fields with special types such as `date` or `geo_shape`.

::: warning
Once a type has been defined for a field, it is not possible to modify it later.
:::

The main types are the following:
 - [keyword](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.4/keyword.html): used to store any string that represent structured content (e.g. `firstname`, `category`, etc)
 - [text](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.4/text.html): used to store texts and unstructured data (e.g. `description`, `email-body`, etc)
 - [integer, float, etc](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.4/number.html): used to store numbers
 - [date](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.4/date.html): used to store dates in different formats
 - [geo_point](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.4/geo-point.html): used to store lat/long coordinates

::: info
Nested fields can be declared by using the `properties` key instead of `type`. Then you can define nested fields inside this object.
:::

**Example:** _Declaring a collection mappings to correctly index a document_

The following mappings must be defined first:
```bash
kourou collection:create ktm-open-data thamel-taxi '{
  mappings: {
    properties: {
      category: { type: "keyword" },
      distance: { type: "integer" },
      position: { type: "geo_point" },
      driver: {
        properties: {
          name: { type: "keyword" }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}'
```

Then we can create a document which is going to be correctly indexed:
```bash
kourou document:create ktm-open-data thamel-taxi '{
  category: "limousine",
  distance: 120990,
  position: {
    lat: 27.730400,
    lon: 85.328467
  },
  driver: {
    name: "liia mery"
  }
}'
```

::: info
Refer to the Elasticsearch documentation for an exhaustive list of available types: [Elasticsearch mapping types](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.4/mapping-types.html)
:::

#### Arrays

With Elasticsearch, **every field can be an array**. 

To store an array of values, you can just send it as-is instead of a single value:
```bash
# Create a document with an array of category
kourou document:create ktm-open-data thamel-taxi '{
  category: ["limousine", "suv"],
}' --id document-1
```

If you want to **modify an existing array**, you need to **send it in its entirety**:
```bash
# Add the "4x4" value to the category array
kourou document:update ktm-open-data thamel-taxi '{
  category: ["limousine", "suv", "4x4"],
}'
```

::: info
If you need to frequently insert and remove values to a field then you should either use a nested object instead or use a [scripting language](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/modules-scripting-painless.html) to modify the array.  
For security reasons, Kuzzle does not provide any access to scripts through its API. Scripts are only supported through the [Integrated Elasticsearch Client](/core/2/guides/main-concepts/data-storage#integrated-elasticsearch-client) available to applications and to plugins.
:::

Nested fields arrays can be represented in two differents ways:
 - [object](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.4/object.html): used to store JSON objects
 - [nested](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.4/nested.html): used to store array of structured JSON objects

The choice of a type rather than another one modifies the way Elasticsearch will index the field. If there is a **need to search inside your object array** then you should choose the `nested` type otherwise the default `object` type will be **less resource intensive**.

**Example:** _Create a collection with an `object` type and a `nested` type_
```bash
kourou collection:create ktm-open-data thamel-taxi '{
  mappings: {
    properties: {
      drivers: {
        properties: {
          name: { type: "keyword" },
          age: { type: "integer" }
        }
      },
      cars: {
        type: "nested",
        properties: {
          name: { type: "keyword" },
          year: { type: "integer" }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}'
```

### Mappings Dynamic Policy

For each collection, you can set the **policy against new fields that are not referenced** in the collection mapping by modifying the `dynamic` root field.

The value of this configuration will change the way Elasticsearch manages the creation of new fields that are not declared in the collection mappings.
  - `"true"`: stores the document and updates the collection mapping with the inferred type 
  - `"false"`: stores the document and does not update the collection mappings (fields are not indexed)
  - `"strict"`: rejects the document

::: info
Kuzzle will accept either string or boolean values for the dynamic property but it's advised to always use string values.
:::

Refer to Elasticsearch documentation for more informations: [Elasticsearch dynamic mapping](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/dynamic-mapping.html)

The default policy for new collections is `"true"` and is configurable in the [kuzzlerc](/core/2/guides/advanced/configuration) file under the key `services.storageEngine.commonMapping.dynamic`.

::: warning
We advise not to let Elasticsearch dynamically infer the type of new fields in production.  
Allowing dynamic fields can be a problem because then the mappings cannot be modified, not to mention the cost of indexing potentially unwanted new fields.
:::

It is also possible to specify a **different dynamic mapping policy for nested fields**. This can be useful in imposing a strict policy on the collection while allowing the introduction of new fields in a specific location.

**Example:** _Use a different policy for a nested field_
```bash
kourou collection:create ktm-open-data thamel-taxi '{
  mappings: {
    dynamic: "strict",
    properties: {
      category: { type: "keyword" },
      characteristics: {
        dynamic: "false",
        properties: {}
      }
    }
  }
}'
```

Then if you try to create a document with a field that is not referenced you will get an error:
```bash
kourou document:create ktm-open-data thamel-taxi '{
  category: "suv",
  ecologic: false
}'
```

But you can create a document with a non-referenced field inside the `characteristics` field:
```bash
kourou document:create ktm-open-data thamel-taxi '{
  category: "suv",
  characteristics: {
    argus: 4200
  }
}'
```

### Mappings Metadata

Elasticsearch allows the **definition of metadata that is stored next to the collections** in the root field `_meta`.
These metadata are ignored by Elasticsearch, they can contain any type of information specific to your application.

::: warning
Unlike the properties types definition, new collection metadata are not merged with the old one.

If you set the `_meta` field in your request, the old value will be overwritten.
:::

Refer to Elasticsearch documentation for more information: [Elasticsearch mapping meta field](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.4/mapping-meta-field.html)

**Example:** _Create a collection with metadata_
```bash
kourou collection:create ktm-open-data thamel-taxi '{
  _meta: {
    postgresTable: "thamelTaxi"
  }
}'
```

These metadata can be retrieved with the [collection:getMapping](/core/2/api/controllers/collection/get-mapping) API action:
```bash
kourou collection:getMapping ktm-open-data thamel-taxi
```

### Load Mappings

It is possible to **load mappings from several collections** at once using the [admin:loadMappings](/core/2/api/controllers/admin/load-mappings) action.  

This action takes as parameter a definition of a set of indexes and collections with their associated mappings.  

The expected format is the following:
```js
{
  "<index>": {
    "<collection>": {
      "properties": {
        "<field>": {}
      }
    }
  },
  "<index>": {
    "<collection>": {
      "properties": {
        "<field>": {}
      }
    }
  }
}

```

::: info
It is recommended to **save the mappings of your application in a JSON file**.
:::

```bash
# Create a file containing the mappings
echo '
{
  "nyc-open-data": {
    "yellow-tax": {
      "properties": {
        "name": { "type": "keyword" },
        "age": { "type": "integer" }
      }
    }
  }
}
' > mappings.json

# Load it with Kourou
kourou admin:loadMappings < mappings.json
```

::: info
Kourou can read file content and put it the request body.
:::

<!-- 
  @todo load at startup with Kaaf
-->

## Collection Settings

In addition mappings, Elasticsearch exposes [settings](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.4/index-modules.html#index-modules-settings) that allow to finely configure the behavior of a collection.

These settings allow to configure [custom analyzers](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.4/analysis-custom-analyzer.html) for example.


```bash
kourou collection:create ktm-open-data:yellow-taxi '{
  "settings": {
    "analysis": {
      "analyzer": {
        "my_custom_analyzer": {
          "type": "custom", 
          "tokenizer": "standard",
          "char_filter": [
            "html_strip"
          ],
          "filter": [
            "lowercase",
            "asciifolding"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}'
```

::: warning
While updating the collection settings, the collection will be [closed](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.5/indices-close.html) until the new configuration has been applied.
:::


## Kuzzle Metadata

Whenever a **document is created, updated or deleted**, Kuzzle will **add or update the document's metadata**. These metadata provide information about the document's lifecycle.

::: info
You can bypass metadata automatic creation by using [bulk:write](/core/2/api/controllers/bulk/write) or [bulk:mWrite](/core/2/api/controllers/bulk/m-write) actions.
:::

Metadata can be viewed in the document's `_kuzzle_info` field and contains the following properties:

- `author`: [kuzzle user identifier](/core/2/guides/main-concepts/authentication#kuzzle-user-identifier-kuid) of the user who created the document.
- `createdAt`: timestamp of document creation (create or replace), in epoch-milliseconds format.
- `updatedAt`: timestamp of last document update in epoch-milliseconds format, or `null` if no update has been made.
- `updater`: [kuzzle user identifier](/core/2/guides/main-concepts/authentication#kuzzle-user-identifier-kuid) of the user that updated the document, or `null` if the document has never been updated.

Here is an example of a Kuzzle response, containing a document's `_id` and `_source` fields:

```bash
kourou document:create ktm-open-data thamel-taxi '{
  driver: {
    name: "liia mery"
  }
}'

# Created document
{
  "_id": "bfKYl3UBKAwUi8z83JJG",
  "_source": {
    "driver": {
      "name": "liia mery"
    },
    "_kuzzle_info": {
      "author": "-1", # Anonymous user ID
      "createdAt": 1604566178884,
      "updatedAt": null,
      "updater": null
    }
  }
}
```

::: info
Metadata cannot be edited manually (except with [bulk:write](/core/2/api/controllers/bulk/write) or [bulk:mWrite](/core/2/api/controllers/bulk/m-write) actions). Kuzzle will discard any `_kuzzle_info` property sent in document content.  
::: 

### Metadata mappings

Kuzzle metadata default mappings is defined with default collection mappings under the key `services.storageEngine.commonMapping` of the [configuration](/core/2/guides/advanced/configuration) file.

```js
{
  "services": {
    // [...]
    "storageEngine": {
      // [...]
      "commonMapping": {
        "dynamic": "false",
        "properties": {
          "_kuzzle_info": {
            "properties": {
              "author":     { "type": "keyword" },
              "createdAt":  { "type": "date" },
              "updatedAt":  { "type": "date" },
              "updater":    { "type": "keyword" }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Query on metadata

Kuzzle allows **search requests to access metadata directly**. This means that you'll have to search in the `_kuzzle_info` document property.

For example, to sort documents by creation date, we can use the following search query:

```bash
kourou document:search ktm-open-data thamel-taxi --sort '{
  "_kuzzle_info.createdAt": "asc" 
}'
```

## Write Documents

Kuzzle exposes many methods for writing documents. Most of them are actions of the [document](/core/2/api/controllers/document) controller.

### Write Single Document

Actions that allow writing a single document take the content of the document to be written in the request `body`.

Apart from the [document:create](/core/2/api/controllers/document/create) action, they also take the document `_id` as a parameter.

**Example:** _Create a document with the [document:createOrReplace](/core/2/api/controllers/document/create-or-replace) action_

```bash
kourou document:createOrReplace ktm-open-data thamel-taxi '{
  driver: {
    name: "liia mery"
  }
}' --id liia
```

The [document:update](/core/2/api/controllers/document/update) action differs from other write actions because it takes a partial content with the field to update in the request `body`.

**Example:** _Partially update a document with the [document:createOrReplace](/core/2/api/controllers/document/create-or-replace) action_

```bash
kourou document:update ktm-open-data thamel-taxi '{
  category: "limousine"
}' --id liia
```

### Write Multiple Documents

If you need to **write multiple documents at once**, it is recommended to use one of the `m*` actions.  

::: info
If you need to create large volume of documents the fastest way possible then you should use the [bulk:import](/core/2/api/controllers/bulk/import) action.
:::

These actions work in the same way as single document actions (`createOrReplace` becomes `mCreateOrReplace`, `update` becomes `mUpdate`, etc) but by taking an array of documents in the `body` request.

**Example:** _Create multiple documents with the [document:mCreate](/core/2/api/controllers/document/m-create) action_

<!-- 
  @todo deprecate "body" and use "content" instead
-->

```bash
kourou document:mCreate ktm-open-data thamel-taxi '{
  documents: [
    {
      _id: "liia-mery",
      body: {
        driver: {
          name: "liia mery"
        },
        category: "limousine"
      }
    },
    {
      body: {
        driver: {
          name: "aschen"
        },
        category: "suv"
      }
    }
  ]
}'
```

### Write Limit

Kuzzle imposes a **limit to the number of documents that can be written by the same request**.

This limit ensures that Kuzzle and Elasticsearch are not overloaded by writing too many documents at once.

By default, this limit is `200` documents per request. It is possible to configure this value in the `limits.documentsWriteCount` key in the [configuration](/core/2/guides/advanced/configuration) file.

## Read Documents

Kuzzle exposes methods to read documents. There are two way of retrieving documents:
 - using a document unique identifier (`_id` field)
 - with a [search query](/core/2/guides/main-concepts/querying)

### Retrieve Documents by _id

**Example:** _Retrieve a document by it's `_id` with [document:get](/core/2/api/controllers/document/get)_
```bash
kourou document:createOrReplace ktm-open-data thamel-taxi '{
  driver: {
    name: "liia mery"
  }
}' --id liia

kourou document:get ktm-open-data thamel-taxi --id liia
```

It's also possible to retrieve multiple documents at once with the [document:mGet]([document:get](/core/2/api/controllers/document/get)) action.

This methods takes an array of IDs in the request body.

**Example:** _Retrieve multiple documents_
```bash
kourou document:createOrReplace ktm-open-data thamel-taxi '{
  driver: {
    name: "aschen"
  }
}' --id aschen

kourou document:mGet ktm-open-data thamel-taxi '{
  ids: ["liia", "aschen"]
}'
```

### Search for Documents

Searches can be made to retrieve only the documents you want.

These searches are done by **writing Elasticsearch queries**.

You can consult the dedicated guide: [Querying](/core/2/guides/main-concepts/querying)

### Read Limit

Kuzzle imposes a **limit to the number of documents that can be returned by the same request**.

This limit ensures that Kuzzle and Elasticsearch are not overloaded by returning too many documents at once.

By default, this limit is `10000` documents per request. It is possible to configure this value in the `limits.documentsFetchCount` key in the [configuration](/core/2/guides/advanced/configuration) file.

## Bulk Actions

To perform lower level actions, it is possible to use the [bulk](/core/2/api/controllers/bulk) controller.

The actions of this controller may not follow some of the API principles such as:
 - adding [Kuzzle Metadata](/core/2/guides/main-concepts/data-storage#kuzzle-metadata)
 - triggering [Database Notifications](/core/2/guides/main-concepts/realtime-engine#database-notifications) 
 - application of [Data Validation](/core/2/guides/advanced/data-validation) rules
 - respect of [write limit](/core/2/guides/main-concepts/data-storage#write-limit)

The following actions are available:
 - [bulk:write](/core/2/api/controllers/bulk/write): write a document
 - [bulk:mWrite](/core/2/api/controllers/bulk/m-write): write multiple documents
 - [bulk:import](/core/2/api/controllers/bulk/import): import documents as fast as possible
 - [bulk:deleteByQuery](/core/2/api/controllers/bulk/write): delete large volume of documents matching a query

::: warning
Bulk actions are intended to be used by administrators and scripts.  
It is considered harmful to let end users execute those actions.
:::

## Integrated Elasticsearch Client

Kuzzle uses and exposes the [Elasticsearch Javascript SDK](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/api-reference.html). 

It is possible to **interact directly with Elasticsearch** through clients exposed in the [Backend.storage](/core/2/framework/classes/backend-storage) property.

This property offers the possibility to **instantiate a new client** or to **use a lazy-instantiated client**. In both cases, the clients are configured to use the same Elasticsearch cluster as Kuzzle.

::: info
It is possible to overload the configuration used by default by instantiating a new Elasticsearch client with the constructor [Backend.storage.ESClient](/core/2/framework/classes/backend-storage#properties).
:::


**Example:** _Send a request directly to Elasticsearch_

```js
// Elasticsearch request to create a document
const esRequest =  {
  body: {
    name: 'Aschen',
    age: 27
  },
  // Internal name of the index "nyc-open-data" and the collection "yellow-taxi"
  index: '&nyc-open-data.yellow-taxi',
  op_type: 'create'
};

// Use directly an Elasticsearch client instance
await app.storage.client.index(esRequest);

// Instantiate and use a new client
const storageClient = new app.storage.Client();
await storageClient.index(esRequest);
```

::: warning
Kuzzle uses an [internal naming system](/core/2/guides/main-concepts/data-storage#internal-representation) to map Elasticsearch index names with Kuzzle indexes and collections names.
:::
