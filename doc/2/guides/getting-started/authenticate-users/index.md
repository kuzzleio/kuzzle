# Authenticate Users

Kuzzle's authentication system is **multi-strategy based**. This means that the same user can **authenticate in several different ways**.

For example, the same user can authenticate with the [local](/core/2/guides/main-concepts/authentication#local-strategy) strategy with an username and a password pair but also with the [oauth](/core/2/guides/main-concepts/authentication#oauth-strategy) strategy using an external provider such as Facebook or Google.

::: info
Kuzzle uses [Passport.js](http://www.passportjs.org/) under the hood, and therefore there are 300+ strategies readily available. (LDAP, OpenID, Active Directory, x509, etc.)  
:::

We saw that in the [Set Up Permission](/core/2/guides/getting-started/set-up-permissions) guide, when creating a user, we had to provide credentials for the [local](/core/2/guides/main-concepts/authentication#local-strategy) strategy, but we could have provided more strategies (provided the right strategy plugins are used):

```js
{
  // User profiles
  content: {
    profileIds: ["dummy"]
  },

  // User credentials
  credentials: {

    // User will be able to login with the "local" strategy
    local: {
      username: "najada",
      password: "password"
    },

    // User will be able to login with the "ldap" strategy
    ldap: {
      bindDN: "cn=root",
      searchBase: "ou=passport-ldapauth",
      searchFilter: "(uid=najada)"
    }
  }
}
```

::: warning
New authentication strategies are made available by [authentication plugins](/core/2/guides/write-plugins/integrate-authentication-strategy).  

By default, only the [local strategy](/core/2/guides/main-concepts/authentication#local-strategy) is available.  

We also provide an authentication plugin for the [OAuth strategy](/core/2/guides/main-concepts/authentication#oauth-strategy) but it's not available by default and need to be [added to your application](/core/2/guides/develop-on-kuzzle/external-plugins).

### Getting an authentication token

Kuzzle uses **authentication tokens** to identify user sessions.  

First we need to get one with the [auth:login](/core/2/api/controllers/auth/login) action. This action takes the `strategy` used as a mean to authenticate, and any additional information needed by that strategy.

In our example we will use the [local](/core/2/guides/main-concepts/authentication#local-strategy) strategy so we have to provide a `username` and a `password`:

```bash
kourou auth:login -a strategy=local --body '{
  username: "melis",
  password: "password"
}'

[â„¹] Unknown command "auth:login", fallback to API method
 
 ðŸš€ Kourou - Executes an API query.
 
 [â„¹] Connecting to http://localhost:7512 ...
 {
  "_id": "62843356-d826-42fb-adf1-e930e90b6006",
  "expiresAt": 1602600225701,
  "jwt": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJfaWQiOiI2Mjg0MzM1Ni1kODI2LTQyZmItYWRmMS1lOTMwZTkwYjYwMDYiLCJpYXQiOjE2MDI1OTY2MjUsImV4cCI6MTYwMjYwMDIyNX0.0HZF_AhyTzPCRxdaMbT6hlwLflYG4emmLlTD6YV_Nmo",
  "ttl": 3600000
 }
 [âœ”] Successfully executed "auth:login"
```

Kuzzle sent us back the token in the `jwt` property

::: warning
Usually, login attempts are made by anonymous users, to acquire a token granting the necessary rights to perform more actions.

Since removing rights to the `auth:login` action from anonymous users would mean that it would be no longer possible to log in, Kuzzle prevents that action from ever be removed from the `anonymous` role.
:::

### Using an authentication token

Now that we have a token, we must pass it to API requests, either in the **HTTP headers** or in the **Kuzzle request payload**, depending on what network protocol is used.

::: info
When using Kourou with `--username` and `--password` flags, the [auth:login](/core/2/api/controllers/auth/login) action is called and the received token is automatically used along with subsequent requests.

:::: tabs
::: tab Kourou

```bash
kourou auth:getCurrentUser -a jwt=<token>
```

:::
::: tab HTTP

``` bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" http://localhost:7512/_me
```

:::
::: tab WebSocket

```bash
npx wscat -c ws://localhost:7512 --execute '{
  "controller": "auth",
  "action": "getCurrentUser",
  "jwt": "<token>"
}'
```

:::

::: tab Javascript

```bash
kourou sdk:execute '
  sdk.jwt = "<token>";

  console.log(await sdk.auth.getCurrentUser());
'
```

::: info
Kourou is able to [execute](https://github.com/kuzzleio/kourou/blob/master/README.md#kourou-sdkexecute-code) Javascript code snippets.  
A `sdk` variable is exposed and refers to an instance of the [Javascript SDK](/sdk/js/7), connected to Kuzzle and authenticated if credentials are provided.
