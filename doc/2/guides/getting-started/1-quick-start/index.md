# Quick Start

Kuzzle is a Node.js application that can be installed on every platforms.

It only requires two services: Elasticsearch and Redis.

In this guide we will use Docker and Docker Compose to run those services.

Prerequisites:
 - [Node.js >= 12](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (with NPM)
 - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
 - [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Throughout this guide, we will need to use [Kourou](https://github.com/kuzzleio/kourou), the Kuzzle CLI.

You can install Kourou globally by using NPM: `npm install -g kourou`

First, we will initialize a new application using Kourou:

```bash
$ kourou app:scaffold playground
 
 ðŸš€ Kourou - Scaffolds a new Kuzzle application
 
 [â„¹] Scaffold a new Kuzzle application in playground/
 [â„¹] Installing latest Kuzzle version via NPM...
 [âœ”] Scaffolding complete. Start to develop you application in ./playground/
```

This will create the following files and directories:

```
playground/
â”œâ”€â”€ app.ts               < application entrypoint        
â”œâ”€â”€ .eslintignore
â”œâ”€â”€ .eslintrc.json
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â”œâ”€â”€ .kuzzlerc            < kuzzle configuration file
â”œâ”€â”€ lib                  < application code
â”œâ”€â”€ .mocharc.json
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ package-lock.json
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Now we have to run Kuzzle services, namely Elasticsearch and Redis.

Again you can use Kourou for that: `kourou app:start-services`

The `app.ts` file contain the basic code to run a Kuzzle application. This file is meant to be executed with Node.js as any application.

```ts
import { Backend } from 'kuzzle'

const app = new Backend('playground')

app.start()
  .then(() => {
    app.log.info('Application started')
  })
  .catch(console.error)
```

We can now run our first application with `npm run dev`

::: info
Under the hood, the command `npm run dev` use [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) and [ts-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node) to run the application.
