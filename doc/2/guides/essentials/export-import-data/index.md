# Export and import data

All Kuzzle data are contained in Elasticsearch and separated into two categories:

Public data representing documents created by users within collections.  
They are accessible through the API with the controllers `index`, `collection`, `document` and `realtime`.  

Internal indexes, containing data used internally by Kuzzle.  
Users, profiles and roles are examples of internal documents.  
These data are not directly accessible like public data, but only through methods exposed in the `auth` and `security` controllers.  

## Backup entire Kuzzle content

If you want to make a complete backup of all the data contained in Kuzzle (public and internal), you can use [Elasticdump](https://www.npmjs.com/package/elasticdump#multielasticdump).

Elasticdump will generate JSON files containing: 
 - the mappings of the Elasticsearch indexes
 - the documents 
 - analyzers

::: info
The content of a dump allows to completely restore the state of a Kuzzle cluster after an incident for example.
:::

```bash
$ multielasticdump --direction dump --input http://localhost:9200 --output ./dump
```

## Restore the entire Kuzzle content

If you want to restore the entire Kuzzle data (public and internal) from a full backup, you can use [Elasticdump](https://www.npmjs.com/package/elasticdump#multielasticdump).  

::: info
It is advisable to turn off Kuzzle during import because this operation is not atomic and the interactions performed with the API during import could cause integrity problems.
:::

```bash
$ multielasticdump --direction load --input ./dump --output http://localhost:9200
```

## Export public data

Public data can be exported with [Kourou, the Kuzzle CLI](https://github.com/kuzzleio/kourou).  

To export your data with Kourou, you can use the commands [index:export](https://github.com/kuzzleio/kourou/#kourou-indexexport-index) or [collection:export](https://github.com/kuzzleio/kourou/#kourou-collectionexport-index-collection).    

These commands will extract all the data contained in the collections and save them in JSONL format.  

The mapping associated with each collection will also be exported and saved next to the data file.

```bash
# Export index "nyc-open-data" to directory "./dump/nyc-open-data"
$ kourou index:export nyc-open-data ./dump/

 Â Â  â””â”€â”€ mappings.json
```

## Import public data

Public data can be imported with [Kourou, the Kuzzle CLI](https://github.com/kuzzleio/kourou).

To import your data, you can use the commands [index:import](https://github.com/kuzzleio/kourou/#kourou-indeximport-path) or [collection:import](https://github.com/kuzzleio/kourou/#kourou-collectionimport-path).

These commands use the files generated by the export commands to import the collections and their documents into Kuzzle.  

::: info
It is possible to import only the data with the `--no-mappings` option.
:::

```bash
$ kourou index:import ./nyc-open-data       
 
 ðŸš€ Kourou - Import a previously dumped index

 [â„¹] Successfully imported 21782 documents in "nyc-open-data:green-taxi"
 [âœ”] Dump directory nyc-open-data/green-taxi imported
```

## Export internal data

To export all internal data, you can use [Elasticdump](https://www.npmjs.com/package/elasticdump#multielasticdump) and export all internal collections.  

This will export:
 - data from the internal collections: `roles`, `profiles`, `users`, `api-keys`, `validations` and `config`.
 - plugin collections

::: warning
It is necessary to export the plugin collections if you want to keep the user authentication information because they are stored in the internal storage space of each plugin.  
:::

```bash
# Export all internal collections
$ multielasticdump --direction dump --input http://localhost:9200 --output ./dump --match '%'.
```

::: info
If you want to export only roles and profiles, you can use the commands `kourou role:export` and `kourou profile:export`.
:::

## Import internal data

To import internal data, you can use [Elasticdump](https://www.npmjs.com/package/elasticdump#multielasticdump) and the files generated by the export.  

::: warning
It is advisable to turn off Kuzzle during import because this operation is not atomic and the interactions performed with the API during import could cause integrity problems. 
:::

```bash
$ multielasticdump --direction load --input ./dump --output http://localhost:9200
```
