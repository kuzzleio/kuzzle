# Installing Kuzzle

In this section we'll describe different ways of installing Kuzzle.

---

## Automated script

The easiest way to install Kuzzle is by using our installation script:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl https://get.kuzzle.io)"
```

---

## Docker

Before launching Kuzzle using Docker containers, ensure that your system meets the following requirements:

- **64-bit environment**
- **At least 1.4GB of memory**
- **Docker v1.10+**, see [instructions here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation)
- **Docker Compose v1.8+**, see [instructions here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install)

::: info
Before starting the docker stack, you need to increase the maximum amount of virtual memory in order to run Elasticsearch, which is part of our stack (see why [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.3/_maximum_map_count_check.html)):

```bash
sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
```

To make this configuration permanent, you need to update your `/etc/sysctl.conf` file:

```bash
echo "vm.max_map_count=262144" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
```

On MacOS, Docker is running inside a Linux VM, so you need to apply these settings to it instead of your own system.  
The following command lets you access the VM used by Docker:

```bash
screen ~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/Data/vms/0/tty
```
:::


To start a kuzzle-in-docker stack:

```bash
mkdir kuzzle-docker
cd kuzzle-docker
wget http://kuzzle.io/docker-compose.yml
docker-compose up
```

Your terminal should now be logging startup messages from the Kuzzle stack. After a few seconds, you should see the following message:

```bash
# kuzzle_1         | [✔] Kuzzle server ready
```

Your Kuzzle is now up and running. For a quick test, you can explore the main HTTP API endpoint by clicking this link [http://localhost:7512](http://localhost:7512) or by using cURL on the command line:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:7512?pretty"
```

## AWS Marketplace

<DeprecatedBadge since="2.0.0">

::: info
To create a new Kuzzle stack on Amazon, you need a valid AWS account.
:::

In this guide, you'll learn where to find our AWS Marketplace AMI and how to use it. It's a good way to test Kuzzle in a cloud environment. In addition, we recommend that you use our [Kuzzle Admin Console](http://console.kuzzle.io), the easiest way to play with Kuzzle.

### Get the AMI

Our AMI is stored on AWS Marketplace. It's set up with:

- Ubuntu (**16.04**)
- Kuzzle (**v1**) with MQTT protocol support.
- Elasticsearch (**v5.4.1**).
- Redis (**v3.2.12**).

Go to the marketplace and type **kuzzle** in the search form.
Choose your Amazon EC2 instance type (the minimal requirement is a **t2-medium**).
Recover the public IP or the hostname provided by AWS before you proceed.
Check that Kuzzle is up and running with following HTTP request:

```sh
# Replace kuzzle with your instance hostname or IP
$ curl 'http://kuzzle:7512?pretty'
{
  "requestId": "9b07a095-7143-49a5-9079-a34e937fdf3e",
  "status": 200,
  "error": null,
  "controller": "server",
  "action": "info",
  "collection": null,
  "index": null,
  "volatile": null,
  "result": {
    # Exhaustive Kuzzle information
  }
}
```

You should see information about your Kuzzle Server.
If not, wait a few minutes and retry the request.

### Connect with default credentials

Open the [Kuzzle Admin Console](http://console.kuzzle.io) and fill the form with the address of your Kuzzle instance. There is a default admin user with **ec2-user** as username.
Associated password is your unique instance ID. You can get it from the EC2 AWS Console, it looks like this: **i-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx**.

## Manual Installation

In this section we will perform a manual installation of Kuzzle on a Linux distribution. We choose Linux because all Kuzzle components work natively on it.

::: info
By default, Kuzzle expects all the components to be running on localhost but you can [change](/core/2/guides/essentials/configuration)'ll be able to select which [Kuzzle](/core/2/guides/essentials/admin-console#connect-to-kuzzle) installation that you want to manage. this behavior.
:::

We will run Kuzzle using [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/), a process management tool used to reload Node.js applications on code changes.

### Supported operating systems

The following operating systems are actively supported (64-bit versions only):

- Ubuntu: 18.04+
- Debian: 8+

### Prerequisites

- [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack) version 7.4.x or higher
- [Redis](http://redis.io) version 5.x or higher
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) version 12.x or higher
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) version 6 or higher
- [Python](https://www.python.org) 2.7, 3.5 or higher
- [GDB](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb) version 7.7 or higher
- a C++11 compatible compiler
- it's strongly advised that the system value for the maximum number of opened files (`ulimit -n` on most Unix systems) is set to a high value (i.e. 65535 is a good min. value)

::: info
The last three prerequisites can be fulfilled on Debian-based systems by installing packages : `build-essential`, `gdb` and `python`.
:::

---

### Get Kuzzle source code

Let's start by creating the `kuzzle` root folder:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/kuzzle
cd ~/kuzzle
```

Then clone the Kuzzle repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kuzzleio/kuzzle.git
```

Now install Kuzzle packages using NPM. Make sure you have installed a `C++11 compatible compiler` or the packages will not build properly, causing problems during the installation process or when running.

```bash
# open the cloned kuzzle repo folder
cd kuzzle
# run npm install to download packages
npm install
```

The package installation can take a few minutes. Once it completes, install Kuzzle plugins by creating and running the following bash script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# init submodules to install defaults kuzzle plugins
git submodule init
git submodule update

# install dependencies for all enabled plugins
for PLUGIN in ./plugins/enabled/*; do
  if [ -d "${PLUGIN}" ]; then
    ( cd "${PLUGIN}" && npm install )
  fi
done
```

#### Configure Kuzzle components

Kuzzle uses Elasticsearch and Redis as a persistent and key-value store, respectively. If you are running these components on the same machine as your Kuzzle installation then no additional configuration is needed. If; however, you are running them on another host, you will need to create or update the `.kuzzlerc` file in your installation folder.

Please refer to the [configuration section](/core/2/guides/essentials/configuration) for more details.

### Setup Nodemon

Now that you have installed Kuzzle and loaded its plugins, let's install nodemon. Run the following command to install nodemon using NPM as a global package so that it can be run from anywhere on your machine:

```bash
sudo npm install -g nodemon
```

Nodemon will automatically reload Kuzzle when it detects changes in the code.  

Now we are gonna run Kuzzle, don't forget to add the Node.js debugger entrypoint if you want to debug either the Chrome inspector or your IDE.

Run the following commands:

```bash
nodemon --inspect=0.0.0.0:9229 bin/start-kuzzle-server
```

You should then see the following display on your terminal:

```
[2020-21-42 09:40:48+00:00] - Starting Kuzzle...
[nodemon] 2.0.4
[nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
[nodemon] watching path(s): *.*
[nodemon] watching extensions: js,mjs,json
[nodemon] starting `node --inspect=0.0.0.0:9229  bin/start-kuzzle-server`
[ℹ] Starting Kuzzle server

[...]

```

You should see the following message if Kuzzle successfully started (it may take a few seconds):

```bash
[✔] Kuzzle server ready
```

Kuzzle can now be reached at the following URL, using either HTTP or WebSocket: `http://localhost:7512/`

### Troubleshooting

If you see the following message during the `NPM install` process then make sure you have installed a C++11 compatible compiler:

```

If you see the following message make sure that you have installed Elasticsearch and that it is accessible at 127.0.0.1:9200. If Elasticsearch is running on another server or port, configure `.kuzzlerc` accordingly:

```

If you see the following message make sure that you have installed Redis and that it is accessible at 127.0.0.1:6379. If Redis is running on another server or port, configure `.kuzzlerc` accordingly:

```
