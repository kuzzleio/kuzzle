# What is Kuzzle

If you're on this page it's probably because you need a backend for your mobile, web or IoT application.

Once again you had been preparing to develop a backend from scratch... Well, maybe not entirely from scratch, because you probably planned to use some kind of framework (and there are a lot of them!) to make it easier for you.  
Those frameworks allow you to develop faster by providing a predefined structure, classes and configurations.


However, you will still have to develop the majority of the basic features:
 - storing and searching data
 - permission management
 - user authentication
 - access to data and functionalities through an API

Each of these features will take time. Time to develop but also time to:
 - debug
 - test 
 - maintain
 - secure

In short, once again you were going to spend a lot of time on code that doesn't bring any value to your users but is nevertheless essential.

This time could have been used for many other things:
 - development of business functionalities
 - UI / UX of frontend applications
 - 100% coverage by automated tests
 - implementation of devops best practices
 - marketing of your product
 - ...

It is on the basis of this failure to optimize development time that we decided to start developing Kuzzle 5 years ago and that we have been devoting all our efforts to it ever since.

## How it works

Kuzzle is a backend with ready-to-use features that can be extended in the same way as any framework.

When you start Kuzzle, you automatically have access to an API exposing the following features:
 - Data storage and access
 - Advanced permission system
 - Multi authentication
 - Multi protocol API (Http, WebSocket, MQTT)
 - Realtime engine
 - Integrated cluster mode
 - and more!
