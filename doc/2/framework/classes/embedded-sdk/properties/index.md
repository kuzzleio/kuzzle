# EmbeddedSDK

The `EmbeddedSDK` is a modified version of the Javascript SDK.

It inherits from the [Kuzzle](/sdk/js/7/core-classes/kuzzle) class of the Javascript SDK.

It is **directly connected to the Kuzzle API** and requests **do not go through the network**.

It is accessible within an application through the [Backend.sdk](/core/2/framework/classes/backend/properties#sdk) property.

See also the [EmbeddedSDK](/core/2/guides/develop-on-kuzzle/embedded-sdk) guide.

## Properties

See the [Kuzzle](/sdk/js/7/core-classes/kuzzle/properties) class of the Javascript SDK.
