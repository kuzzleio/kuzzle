# Repository

The `Repository` class allows to interact with the [Plugin Private Storage](/core/2/guides/some-links).  


An instance of this class provides access to a collection inside the plugin's dedicated and secure storage.

If this is not already the case, the collection must first be created, using the [PluginStorage](/core/2/framework/classes/plugin-storage) class available in the [PluginContextAccessors.storage](/core/2/framework/classes/plugin-context-accessors/properties#storage) property.

::: info
This class does not have any properties.
