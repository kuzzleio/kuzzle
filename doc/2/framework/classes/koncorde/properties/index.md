# Koncorde

Supersonic real-time data percolation engine, featuring a set of [clauses](/core/2/api/koncorde-filters-syntax/clauses) and [operators](/core/2/api/koncorde-filters-syntax/operators) to build fine-grained filters, including geofencing capabilities.

This is the engine used by Kuzzle to handle real-time notifications and data validations.
