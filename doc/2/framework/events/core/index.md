## core:kuzzleStart

<DeprecatedBadge version="2.2.0" />

This event is deprecated, and may be removed in a future version of Kuzzle.
Use [kuzzle:state:ready](/core/2/framework/events/kuzzle) instead.

Triggered when Kuzzle has finished booting and is ready to process user requests.

:::info
Pipes cannot listen to that event, only hooks can.

## core:overload

| --------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `fill`    | <pre>number</pre> | KuzzleRequest buffer fill percentage |

Triggered when the requests buffer fills up more quickly than requests can be processed.

The requests buffer is configurable through the `limits` parameters in the [Kuzzle configuration](/core/2/guides/advanced/configuration).

Requests submitted while the request buffer is completely filled (i.e. the payload is equal to `100`) are rejected with a [ServiceUnavailableError](/core/2/api/errors/types#common-errors) (code `503`)

## core:shutdown

<DeprecatedBadge version="2.2.0" />

This event is deprecated and is now an alias for [kuzzle:shutdown](/core/2/framework/events/kuzzle#kuzzle-shutdown).

It will be removed in a future version.
