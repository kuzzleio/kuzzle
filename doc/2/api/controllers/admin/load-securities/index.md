# loadSecurities

<SinceBadge version="1.7.0" />

Load roles, profiles and users into the storage layer.

The roles, profiles and users definitions follow the same structure as in the body parameter of their corresponding API actions:

 - [security:createRole](/core/2/api/controllers/security/create-role)
 - [security:createProfile](/core/2/api/controllers/security/create-profile)
 - [security:createUser](/core/2/api/controllers/security/create-user)

If users already exist, they will be deleted and then created again.

::: warning
By default, Kuzzle prevents existing user overwriting.  
You can either skip or overwrite existing users with the `onExistingUsers` option.
:::

**Notes:**

* The body can contain any number of roles, profiles and users.
* If a role, profile or user already exists, it will be replaced.
* Fixtures are loaded sequentially: first the roles, then the profiles and finally the users. If a failure occurs, Kuzzle immediately interrupts the sequence, without rollbacking what has already been loaded.
