# addListener

Allows you to listen specific events from the [Chrome Devtool Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/v8) and Debug Modules. You'll receive a notification when an event is emitted.

:::warning
This only works using a Websocket connection since notification can only be sent on a persistent connection.
