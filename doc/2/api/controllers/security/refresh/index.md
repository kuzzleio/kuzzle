# refresh

<SinceBadge version="2.1.0"/>

Forces an immediate [reindexation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.4/docs-refresh.html) of the provided security collection.

The available security collections are: `users`, `profiles`, `roles`.

When writing or deleting documents in Kuzzle, the changes need to be indexed before being reflected in the search results.
By default, this operation can take up to 1 second.

Forcing immediate refreshes comes with performance costs, and should only performed when absolutely necessary.
