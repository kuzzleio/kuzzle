# Common Errors

All Kuzzle requests can return one of the following errors:

## BadRequestError


**status**: 400

A `BadRequestError` error is thrown if Kuzzle was unable to process the action due to a malformed request, or if required parameters are missing.

---

## ExternalServiceError



**status**: 500

An `ExternalServiceError` error is thrown if Kuzzle was unable to process the action due to an external service failure (e.g. database down).

---

## ForbiddenError



**status**: 403

A `ForbiddenError` error is thrown if the current authenticated user is not authorized to perform the requested action.

---

## GatewayTimeoutError



**status**: 504

A `GatewayTimeoutError` error is thrown if Kuzzle, or a plugin, takes too long to respond.

Receiving this error does not guarantee the original request was not processed, just that it was not processed _in time_.

The Client Application will have to determine if the process was completed.

---

## InternalError



**status**: 500

An `InternalError` error is thrown if Kuzzle encountered an unexpected error.

---

## PluginImplementationError



**status**: 500

A `PluginImplementationError` error is a generic error thrown by Kuzzle on a plugin failure.

---

## ServiceUnavailableError



**status**: 503

A `ServiceUnavailableError` error can be sent by Kuzzle if it overloaded and cannot temporarily accept new requests, or if the requested Kuzzle instance is shutting down.

---

# Specific errors

These errors are specific to controller actions.
Check controllers documentation.

## NotFoundError



**status**: 404

A `NotFoundError` error is thrown if the requested resource could not be found (e.g. a document is requested with a non-existing id).

---

## PartialError



**status**: 206

A `PartialError` error is thrown if Kuzzle was unable to process a subset of a multi-action request.

A `PartialError` can be triggered, for instance, if one or several queries inside a `document:mCreate` request failed.

The detail of each failure can be retrieved in the `errors` property of the error object.

**Additional Properties:**

| property | type             | description                    |
| -------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `count`  | integer          | Number of failures encountered |
| `errors` | array of objects | Failed actions                 |

---

## PreconditionError



**status**: 412

A `PreconditionError` error is thrown if Kuzzle was not able to process the request due to an invalid state.

For instance, this error can be generated when trying to create a document on a non-existing index.

---

## SizeLimitError



**status**: 413

A `SizeLimitError` error is thrown by Kuzzle if the request size exceeds the limits defined in the [configuration](/core/2/guides/advanced/configuration).

---

## UnauthorizedError



**status**: 401

An `UnauthorizedError` error is thrown by Kuzzle when an authentication attempt failed, or if a requested resource needs an authentication to be accessed.
