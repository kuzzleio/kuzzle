# WebSocket

The WebSocket protocol is a fairly widespread web standard. It allows to **establish a bidirectional communication channel** between a client and a server.

Due to the persistent nature of its connection, the WebSocket protocol **consumes more energy than HTTP**.

However, it is much **more efficient in sending requests** than HTTP because it does not need to establish a new connection for each new request.

::: info
The use of the **WebSocket protocol is recommended** whenever possible.  
This protocol should be used by default for web applications, machine-to-machine connections, users scripts and CLIs.
:::

### Configuration

The protocol can be configured under the `server.protocols.websocket` section of the [configuration file](/core/2/guides/advanced/configuration).

The listening port can be modified under the `server.port` section of the [configuration file](/core/2/guides/advanced/configuration).

**WebSocket protocol configuration section of the kuzzlerc:**

```js
  "server": {
    // The listening port for HTTP and WebSocket
    "port": 7512,

    "protocols": {
      "websocket": {
        // Set to true to enable WebSocket support
        "enabled": true,

        // The maximum time (in milliseconds) without sending or receiving a
        // message from a client. Once reached, the client's socket is
        // forcibly closed.
        // Contrary to heartbeats (see below), this is a passive check,
        // forcing all clients to actively send either PINGs or messages to
        // maintain their connection active.
        // Set the value to 0 to disable this feature (should only be
        // activated if heartbeat is disabled)
        "idleTimeout": 0,

        // The time, in milliseconds, between the server's PING requests to
        // clients, to make sure they are still active.
        // Setting this value to 0 disables PING requests from the server
        // (it will still respond with a PONG to PING requests from clients).
        // If heartbeat is deactivated, then setting a non-zero value to
        // idleTimeout is strongly recommended to detect and remove
        // dead sockets.
        "heartbeat": 60000
      }
  }
```

::: warning
HTTP and WebSocket protocols share the same underlying server instance.  
Modifying the listening port will impact these two protocols.
