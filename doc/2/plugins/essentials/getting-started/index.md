# Getting started

The best way to start developing a plugin is to use a boilerplate.

We provide a boilerplate that contain a Kuzzle stack that reloads itself whenever a plugin change is detected, making it a handy tool for plugin development.

- [kuzzle-core-plugin-boilerplate](https://github.com/kuzzleio/kuzzle-core-plugin-boilerplate)

Clone this repository to start developing a Kuzzle plugin:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kuzzleio/kuzzle-core-plugin-boilerplate
cd kuzzle-core-plugin-boilerplate
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up
// Kuzzle stack with the plugin is ready
// Edit the file lib/index.js,
// the Kuzzle stack will automaticaly restart to include your modifications
```

The provided `docker-compose.yml` file launches a Kuzzle stack with the `nodemon` module, with the following features:

- Automated Kuzzle restart every time a change is detected in the plugin code

The main Plugin class is defined in the `index.js`. You can start edit it adding:

- [Hooks](/core/2/plugins/guides/hooks)
- [Pipes](/core/2/plugins/guides/pipes)
- [Controllers](/core/2/plugins/guides/controllers)
- [Authentication Strategies](/core/2/plugins/guides/strategies/overview)

We need to provide the `configuration` and the `context` to plugins. In that purpose, plugins must have an `init` function which will have them as parameters : this `init` function is the very first one to be called by Kuzzle and is mandatory to start a plugin. You can now write your own functions and your own routes as described inside the `index.js`. You can also write unit tests : see `steps.js`.

You have now everything you need to start writing your own Kuzzle plugin.
