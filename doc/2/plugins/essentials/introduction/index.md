# Introduction

Kuzzle can be customized and extended using plugins.

This page explains how to install and configure a plugin. The other pages cover the four plugin interfaces exposed by Kuzzle:

- [Hooks](/core/2/plugins/guides/hooks)
- [Pipes](/core/2/plugins/guides/pipes)
- [Controllers](/core/2/plugins/guides/controllers)
- [Authentication Strategies](/core/2/plugins/guides/strategies/overview)

A single plugin can implement as many of those interfaces as necessary.
