# Getting Started

Kuzzle emits numerous events, especially for API requests.

Plugins can [listen](/core/2/plugins/essentials) to events.

And if a plugin adds new API [controllers](/core/2/plugins/guides/controllers), then Kuzzle automatically triggers [dedicated events](/core/2/plugins/guides/events/plugin-events).
