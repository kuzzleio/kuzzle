# Getting Started

Kuzzle emits numerous events, especially for API requests.

Plugins can [listen](/core/1/plugins/essentials/) to events.

And if a plugin adds new API [controllers](/core/1/plugins/guides/controllers), then Kuzzle automatically triggers [dedicated events](/core/1/plugins/guides/events/plugin-events).
