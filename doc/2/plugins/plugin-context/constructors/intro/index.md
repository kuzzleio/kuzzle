# Introduction

The plugin context is an object containing a set of constructors, accessors and various other helpers, allowing plugins to interact with Kuzzle.

Each plugin receives its own context instance, provided to the plugin's [init function](/core/2/plugins/essentials/getting-started#init-function).

This section details the constructors made available in the context.
