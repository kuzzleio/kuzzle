# Introduction

The plugin context is an object containing a set of constructors, accessors and various other helpers, allowing plugins to interact with Kuzzle.

Each plugin receives its own context instance, provided to the plugin's [init function](/plugins/guides/manual-setup/init-function/).

This section details the accessors made available in the context.
