 * Mutex meant to work across a kuzzle cluster.
 *
 * Allow to have a process played on only 1 node, with the other ones waiting
 * until the lock is freed.
 * Also works within a single node: in that case, it's better
 * if lock attempts from different parts of the code use different Mutex
 * instances: each mutex will lock using a unique ID, and the lock can only
 * be freed by that mutex instance, and it alone.
 *
 * /!\ Meant to be used only with 1 independant redis client (single node or
 * cluster). Which is what Kuzzle supports today.
 * If, in the future, Kuzzle is able to support multiple independant
 * Redis servers, then this class needs to implement redlock to properly handle
 * synchronization between servers (see https://redis.io/topics/distlock)
