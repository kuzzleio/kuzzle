## Why Kuzzle ?

Kuzzle is a [generic backend](https://docs.kuzzle.io/core/2/guides/introduction/general-purpose-backend/) offering **the basic building blocks common to every application**.

Rather than developing the same standard features over and over again each time you create a new application, Kuzzle proposes them off the shelf, allowing you to focus on building **high-level, high-value business functionalities**.

Kuzzle enables you to build modern web applications and complex IoT networks in no time.

* **API First**: use a standardised multi-protocol API.
* **Persisted Data**: store your data and perform advanced searches on it.
* **Realtime Notifications**: use the pub/sub system or subscribe to database notifications.
* **User Management**: login, logout and security rules are no more a burden.
* **Extensible**: develop advanced business feature directly with the integrated framework.
* **Client SDKS**: use our SDKs to accelerate the frontend development.

## Kuzzle in production

Kuzzle is production-proof, and can be [deployed anywhere](https://kuzzle.io/products/by-features/on-premises/). 

With Kuzzle, it is possible to deploy applications that can serve tens of thousands of users with very good performances.  

We also provide a plugin to deploy a [Kuzzle cluster](https://github.com/kuzzleio/kuzzle-plugin-cluster) that provides horizontal scalability. In addition, its masterless cluster architecture provides high availability for constant uptime.

Check out our [support plans](https://kuzzle.io/pricing/).

## Run Kuzzle

The easiest way to start a Kuzzle application is to use [Kourou](https://github.com/kuzzleio/kourou):

```bash
npx kourou app:scaffold playground

 ðŸš€ Kourou - Scaffolds a new Kuzzle application
 
  âœ” Creating playground/ directory
  âœ” Creating and rendering application files
  âœ” Installing latest Kuzzle version via NPM and Docker (this can take some time)
 [âœ”] Scaffolding complete! Use "npm run dev:docker" to run your application
```

Then you need to run Kuzzle services, Elasticsearch and Redis: `kourou app:start-services`

Finally you can run your application inside Docker with `npm run dev:docker`

Kuzzle is now listening for requests on the port `7512`!

## Use the framework

Your first Kuzzle application is inside the `app.ts` file.

For example, you can add a new [API Controller](https://docs.kuzzle.io/core/2/guides/develop-on-kuzzle/api-controllers):

```ts
import { Backend } from 'kuzzle'

const app = new Backend('playground')

app.controller.register('greeting', {
  actions: {
    sayHello: {
      handler: async request => `Hello, ${request.input.args.name}` 
    }
  }
})

app.start()
  .then(() => {
    app.log.info('Application started')
  })
  .catch(console.error)
```

Now try to call your new API action by:
 - opening the generated URL in your browser: http://localhost:7512/_/greeting/say-hello?name=Yagmur
 - using Kourou: `npx kourou greeting:sayHello --arg name=Yagmur`
