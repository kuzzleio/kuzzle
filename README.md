## Why Kuzzle ?

Kuzzle is a ready-to-use, **on-premises backend** that enables you to manage your persistent data and be notified in real-time on whatever happens to it. It also provides you with a flexible and powerful user-management system.

Kuzzle enables you to build modern web applications and complex IoT networks in no time.

* **Persisted data**: store your data and perform advanced searches on it.
* **Real-time notifications**: subscribe to fine-grained subsets of data.
* **User Management**: login, logout and security rules are no more a burden.
* **Extensible**: fit Kuzzle to your needs by leveraging the plugin system.

## Kuzzle in production

Kuzzle is production-proof, and can be [deployed anywhere](https://kuzzle.io/products/by-features/on-premises/). 

With Kuzzle, it is possible to deploy applications that can serve tens of thousands of users with very good performances.  

We also provide a plugin to deploy a [Kuzzle cluster](https://github.com/kuzzleio/kuzzle-plugin-cluster) that provides horizontal scalability. In addition, its masterless cluster architecture provides high availability for constant uptime.
